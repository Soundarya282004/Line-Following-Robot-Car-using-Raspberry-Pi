# Line-Following-Robot-Car-using-Raspberry-Pi
This project builds an autonomous robot car that follows a track made of black lines. The robot uses infrared obstacle/line detection sensors to detect the track and control motor movement. Based on sensor input, the car moves forward, turns left/right, or stops to stay between the lines.
